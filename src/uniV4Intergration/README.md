## Uniswap -Morpho Intergration

ChamaDAO enables members to contribute funds, access loans, and manage collective investments transparently via smart contracts. By integrating Uniswap v4, we empower chama members to swap assets, such as USDC to other tokens, directly within our platform, ensuring seamless liquidity for treasury management.

To push the boundaries of DeFi, our team plans to leverage Uniswap v4 hooks in the following ways:

Dynamic Fee Structures: We will implement hooks to adjust swap fees dynamically based on chama treasury strategies, such as reducing fees for stablecoin trades to optimize returns.

Stablecoin-Optimized Pools: We aim to create custom USDC-focused pools to minimize slippage during high-frequency transactions, aligning with the track’s emphasis on stablecoin optimization.

Rehypothecation Hooks: Our platform will enable chama treasuries to rehypothecate swapped assets into Base DeFi protocols, such as Morphos USDC vaults and also other protocols that we settle on in the future, to maximize yield while ensuring composability.

We chose the DeFi Track because ChamaDAO’s integration of Uniswap v4 hooks redefines community finance by blending traditional savings models with advanced DeFi infrastructure. Our composable design allows other Base dApps to integrate with our liquidity pools and smart contracts, fostering ecosystem growth. By addressing the 5-7 million Kenyans reliant on informal savings groups, our project showcases Uniswap v4’s potential to drive financial inclusion, making ChamaDAO a transformative addition to Base’s DeFi ecosystem.
